        <p>
        <h6><strong>DIVERSIFICATION OF GAINS</strong></h6>
        <p>
            By participating in real estate crowdfunding, you can diversify your investment portfolio
            by distributing your investment across multiple properties.</p>
        <h6><strong>ACCESSIBILITY</strong></h6>
        <p>Investing is not within everyone's reach, especially when it comes to properties, as
            it typically requires significant financial backing. However, real estate crowdfunding
            allows for market democratization, giving anyone with savings and an interest in investing
            the opportunity to participate in these ventures.</p>
        <h6><strong>CONVENIENCE</strong></h6>
        <p>
            Investing in real estate crowdfunding does not require a significant amount of time
            to manage the project or to be involved in the construction process.
